    <p>I appreciate Sylvia Plath more as I take in her writing from the perspective of a caring and compassionate friend, and not as a reader eagerly searching for words that will describe my life and give voice to my own experiences. While I do relate, I find myself frustrated and tethered to a poor representation of myself in that perspective, and I appreciate far more the experience of getting to know and love a person who needed compassion so badly. Humanizing the writer in this way creates a companionship in what was previously a solitary experience, which is likely the reason she wrote in the first place.</p>
